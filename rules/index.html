      <h2>Setup</h2>
        <div class="textbox">
          <ol>
            <li>Place your ships either horizontally or vertically 
              (not diagonally) on open squares. Do this in <span style="color: darkgray">secret!</span></li>
            <li>You must put your ships on the grid. Not off the grid. 
              Not overlapping with other ships.</li>
            <li>After you decide your ship placement and the game begins, ships can't be moved.</li>
            <li>No peeking at your opponents ship layout. This is considered cheating.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      <h2>Rules</h2>
      <div class="textbox">
        <ol>
            <li>Flip a coin to decide the order in which turns are taken.</li>
            <li>On your turn, pick a target square and call the letter 
              and number out that it corresponds to.</li>
            <li>On your opponents turn, listen to what target square 
              they call out and if you have a ship placed over that square, mark it with a red X.</li>
            <li>Continue until all the ships of one of the players is destroyed. 
              The last player with surviving ships wins!</li>
        </ol>
